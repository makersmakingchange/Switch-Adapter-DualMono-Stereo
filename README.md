# Dual Mono Stereo Switch Adapter
The Dual-Mono-Stereo Switch Adapter provides a way to connect two assistive switches with 3.5 mm / 1/8 in mono cables to a single 3.5 mm / 1/8 in stereo input on a compatible assistive technology device.

## Usage 
To use the Dual Mono-Stereo Adapter, connect the two assistive switches to the Left and Right Inputs on the adapter. Then connect the adapter to the AT device with a stereo male-to-male extension cable.

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Dual-Mono-Stereo_Adapter_BOM_v1.0.csv) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Open Wobble Switch. The main switch component needs to be ordered online. The rest of the off-the-shelf components are also online or may be available in smaller quantities at your local hardware store or dollar store.


### 2. Print the 3D Printable components

3D print the components. Refer to the [3D Printing Guide](/Documentation/Dual-Mono-Stereo_Adapter_3D_Print_Guide_v1.0.pdf).

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the Device

Reference the [Assembly Guide](/Documentation/Dual-Mono-Stereo_Adapter_Assembly_Guide_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
